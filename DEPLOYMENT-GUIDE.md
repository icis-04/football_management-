2. Click "Add to Home Screen" 
3. Use it like a native app

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Frontend Issues

**Build fails on Vercel:**
- Check the build logs for specific errors
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Try building locally first: `npm run build`

**API connection issues:**
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` is set correctly
- Ensure backend `FRONTEND_URL` includes your Vercel URL

**White screen after deployment:**
- Check if the rewrites are working (vercel.json)
